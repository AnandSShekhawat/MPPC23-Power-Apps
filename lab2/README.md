## 📝 Lab 2 - Tasks

In this lab, you will go though the following tasks:

- Creating A Canvas App With Data From An Excel-File
- Creating A Canvas App With Power Apps Copilot
- Creating A Reminder Workflow With Power Automate Copilot
- Creating A Solution
- Add The Resources Created By Power Apps Copilot To A Solution

## ☑️ Task 1: Create A Canvas App With Data From An Excel-File

With Excel to App, you'll select an Excel file, create an app, and then run the app that you create. Every app created includes screens to browse records, show record details, and create or update records. By generating an app, you can quickly get a working app using Excel data, and then you can customize the app to better suit your needs.

When you upload an Excel file it generates a Dataverse table. With Dataverse's standard and custom tables, you can securely store your data in the cloud. These tables enable you to define your organization's data in a way that is tailored to your business needs, making it easier to use within your apps.

If your environment is in the US region and AI is enabled in your organization, the AI Copilot feature can assist in table creation by suggesting table names, descriptions, column data types, and headers, even if this information is missing from the uploaded file. When Copilot AI is used for table creation, the Copilot card is displayed to indicate that the table was generated by Copilot AI.

In this task, you’ll create an application with data from an Excel table.

9. You should now be viewing the app that has been generated for you in Edit mode.

    ![Generated app](./assets/generated-app.png)

10. To the left of the screen, select the Data icon from the navigation bar. Notice that a Dataverse table, based on the RealEstateProperties.xlsx Excel file, has been created.

    ![Dataverse table](./assets/dataverse-table-from-excel.png)

11. Select the Tree view icon to return to the Tree view.

    ![Tree view](./assets/tree-view.png)

12. On the app main screen, click on the gallery displaying the Real Estate Properties and then click on RecordsGallery1 in the Tree view to expand it.

    ![Records gallery](./assets/properties-gallery-expand.png)

13. Select the ellipsis (…) next to the NextArrow and delete it.

    ![Delete NextArrow](./assets/delete-next-arrow.png)

14. Select the RecordsGallery1 and then select the edit button to put the gallery in edit mode.

    ![Edit gallery](./assets/gallery-edit.png)

15. Reduce the width and move the position of the Title component so that it is towards the right-hand side of the template cell.

    ![Move Title](./assets/address-title-reduced.png)

    The other components should reposition alongside the Title component. If not, then move them until it looks like the screenshot above.

16. Make sure that the gallery is still in edit mode. Select the Title.

17. Make sure that the Text value of the Title component is set to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.Address`

    ![Title formula](./assets/set-title-to-address.png)

18. Now select the Subtitle component in the gallery.

19. Set the Text value of the Subtitle to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.Size`

20. Using the tool bar at the top of the page, change the Size to 13.

    ![Size 13](./assets/change-font-size.png)

21. Finally, select the Body component in the gallery.

22. Set the Text value of the Body to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.Price`

23. Your gallery should now look like this:

    ![Gallery](./assets/gallery-check-after-edits.png)

24. Select the RecordsGallery1 and then select the edit button to put the gallery in edit mode. Then click on Insert > search for Image > and then select the Image component.

    ![Insert Image](./assets/insert-image.png)

25. The image will then be added to your gallery. Reposition and resize the image so that it is in the center of each gallery cell.

27. Enter this output in the Desired format text box:

    `$350,000`

    Then press Enter.

    ![Desired format](./assets/ideas-format.png)

28. Select the generated formula. Then select Apply.

    ![Apply](./assets/select-formula-then-click-apply.png)

    With Power Apps Ideas, the example \($350,000\) which you gave generated a formula:

     `(Text(ThisItem.Price, "$#,##0", "en-US"))` which is now updated in the formula bar for the Price gallery control.

29. Now let’s do the same for the Size control in the subtitle of the gallery. Make sure the gallery is in edit mode. And select the subtitle containing the Size. Then click the lightbulb icon which appears above it.

30. Enter this output in the Desired format text box:

    `Size: 1,800 sq ft`

    Then press Enter.

    You may notice that the ideas section is empty. This may be caused by the lack of information or context required to generate a formula.

    ![Size ideas](./assets/no-ideas.png)

31. So, let’s add more examples. Click + Add examples at least 2 more times.

    ![Add examples](./assets/add-examples.png)

32. Select 2 Current formats and then provide 2 corresponding Desired formats.

    ![Current formats](./assets/more-examples.png)

33. With the added context, Power Apps Ideas now generates a suitable formula for you:

    ![Size formula](./assets/correct-generated-formula.png)

34. Select the generated formula. Then select Apply.

    Your gallery should now be looking like this:

    ![Gallery](./assets/updated-gallery.png)

35. Save the app.

36. Exit the app to return to the Power Apps home page.

    ![Exit app](./assets/exit-app.png)
